# KU-Homework

## Description

- My motivation behind this homework challenge was that I needed to pratice my basic html coding skills and see what I have learned during the first week of the KU coding bootcamp. I built this project because it will help me in the future when I have a job as a web developer. This project makes the existing website more accessible and cleans up the code. I learned that I have a lot of work to do before I really know how to code and that this sort of work is part of what I'll be doing as a full stack web developer.
